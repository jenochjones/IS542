It was good to do a follow the steps project that implement
some of the concepts we have been learning. I never realized 
that a function could be passed as an argument to another function.
I found it useful to hear your thought process as you put together 
the code. I feel reasonably confident with programming in Javascript,
but there are lots of nuances that I don't yet understand. Following 
along with the videos helped to solidify some of the concepts.
